      "article: the thermometer reading mario balotelli shared on social media to prove he was too ill to play against blackburn on wednesday night will make no difference to brendan rodgers . liverpool s manager had already gone cold on the italian  concluding some time ago that he has no future at anfield . rodgers will admit he ignored the warnings about balotelli . he knew jose mourinho considered him  unmanageable  and he listened to the anecdotal evidence he received from the members of his staff who had encountered the troublesome striker during their time at manchester city . but rodgers rather hoped balotelli might be maturing with age  and he made the mistake of thinking he could succeed where others had failed in actually getting through to him . mario balotelli has no future at liverpool after manager brendan rodgers lost patience with the striker . rodgers will admit he ignored the warning signs but had hoped balotelli was maturing as he got older . balotelli shared an image of a thermometer reading to prove he was too ill to play against blackburn . liverpool s manager was desperate too  of course . attempts to recruit other strikers  in particular alexis sanchez  had proved unsuccessful last summer and he was concerned that rickie lambert would not provide ample cover in a champions league season if daniel sturridge suffered further injury problems . he was right to worry about sturridge s physical fragility but wrong  he would probably now concede  to spend  16million on balotelli . for three hours in his office at melwood he attempted to lessen the risk before asking his employers to part with the money . he spoke both to balotelli and his agent  explaining what was expected of every liverpool player and sharing his philosophy on the power of the collective . over the years his c.o.r.e principles speech  commitment . ownership . responsibilities . excellence  had worked with players . he would use a flipchart to deliver his lecture on the standards he demands and  for the most part  players had responded accordingly . but not balotelli . not the player who already had a reputation for having no respect for authority  for his considerable talent or for the clubs he represents . liverpool missed out on alexis sanchez last summer and instead paid  16m to sign balotelli from ac milan . balotelli has endured a torrid time at anfield and has managed to score just once in the premier league . rodgers is saddened by the fact italy international balotelli appears to have no respect for liverpool . crystal palace lrb a rrb lost 31  november 23  2014 reason  hamstring and groin injuries . ludogorets lrb a rrb drew 22  november 26  2014 reason  hamstring and groin injuries . stoke lrb h rrb won 10  november 29  2014 reason  hamstring and groin injuries . leicester lrb a rrb won 13  december 2  2014 reason  hamstring and groin injuries . sunderland lrb h rrb drew 00  december 6  2014 reason  hamstring and groin injuries . basle lrb h rrb drew 11  december 9  2014 reason  hamstring and groin injuries . bournemouth lrb a rrb won 31  december 17  2014 reason  groin injury . arsenal lrb h rrb drew 22  december 21  2014 reason  onematch ban . leicester lrb h rrb drew 22  january 1  2015 reason  not selected . aston villa lrb a rrb won 20  january 17  2015 reason  illness . chelsea lrb h rrb drew 11  januray

2015 reason  not selected . everton lrb a rrb drew 00  february 7  2015 reason  not selected . swansea lrb a rrb won 10  march 16  2015 reason  illness . arsenal lrb a rrb lost 41  april 4  2015 reason  knee injury . blackburn lrb a rrb won 10  april 8  2015 reason  illness . rodgers is saddened by the fact that balotelli appears to have no respect for liverpool  and no apparent willingness to even follow the simplest instructions . in sturridge s absence rodgers told balotelli he needed a striker who would  press  at the point of liverpool s attack  who would play high up the field and in so doing set the pattern of liverpool s play . balotelli  much to his manager s frustration  just would nt do it  in the misguided belief that he knew better . on the training field there have been similar issues  a situation that has offended teammates who do buy into rodgers  methods and want to build on the success they enjoyed last season . so there will be no second chance for balotelli at liverpool next season  no opportunity to redeem himself . rodgers is continuing to use him when absolutely necessary but he is at the very top of a list of players he will be putting up for sale this summer . he has to get him out and put what money he can recover for him to better use  if only to improve morale in a dressing room that probably lost patience with the guy before even he did . liverpool players are offended balotelli has not followed simple instructions from his manager this season .\n",
