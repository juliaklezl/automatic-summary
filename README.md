# automatic-summary
Final course project for the Machine Learning course in MLT in fall 2020.

The data I use is the CNN portion of the CNN-DailyMail Dataset (https://github.com/abisee/cnn-dailymail). I used the tokenized version made available here: https://github.com/JafferWilson/Process-Data-of-CNN-DailyMail. 

For this first version, I roughly followed this tutorial on extractive summarization using a textrank algorithm: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2018/11/introduction-text-summarization-textrank-python/
